# Application Name: Quick README Generator


## Description

Welcome to the README Generator! As a developer, you may want to spend most of your time working on the actual code for your project rather than structuring your README. Well, look no further - with this application built using Node and Inquirer, you can quickly and easily create a well-structured README file just by answering a series of prompts in your CLI.

This application should be ready to go right from download. You may need to do an 'npm install' command with the package.json file in your CLI to ensure that Inquirer and all necessary packages are installed. When you're ready to create your README file, simply open up the application in your integrated terminal, and enter 'node index.js' to start the application.
